###Conceptual Framework

Various layers of rules, implemented over the internet protocol,  enable the illusory experience of a constant and smooth stream of information, while in reality, the data transmission that moves through the intertwined net of nodes which embodies the web,  flows rather like eruptions of packets (Sprenger 2015)⁠. One could refer to the transceiving movement of information over the net as a process in which a digital object is fragmented, streamed as individual packets of data and finally reconstructed on its final destination. During the totality of this dynamics, each packet is subject to a number of micro-decisions and interruptions in the process; these micro-events exert a form of power over each fragment of the digital object being transmitted, influencing directly on its trajectory and arrival time (Sprenger 2015)⁠. 

We will investigate the dynamics of data transmission over the internet and how the conscious act of pealing layers of protocols alters the  information being transmitted, in ways which reveal a deeper understanding on how digital artifacts are mediated and reconstituted in post-digital art practices.
